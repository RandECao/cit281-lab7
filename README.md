# Lab 7

During this lab, I established a personalized GitHub organization dedicated to the CIT Minor. 
The process involved creating a new repository, cloning it to my local machine, setting up
JavaScript folders, and pushing the changes back to GitHub.This organization folder will serve
as a centralized location for all my current and future CIT class projects and labs, facilitating 
easy access and management.

- Repository cloning
- Initialization of Node.js folder
